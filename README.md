## Architecture

`cal.com.alt` reimagines cal.com's design using a pragmatic form of Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture in TypeScriptâ€”_DDD-lite_.

Structured but flexible. Minimal overhead.

## Workspace Structure

```txt
cal.com.alt/
â”œâ”€ apps/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ web/
â”‚  â””â”€ api/
â””â”€ packages/
   â”œâ”€ contexts/              # Bounded contexts
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ <context>-ui/       # Context-specific UI
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ <context>-app/      # Use cases, orchestration
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ <context>-infra/    # Infra wiring: DBs, APIs
   â”‚  â””â”€ <context>-domain/   # Domain logic (pure)
   â””â”€ shared/                # Cross-context utilities
      â”œâ”€ infra-core/         # Shared infrastructure implementations used across app/infra layers
      â”œâ”€ ddd-lite/           # DDD-lite base constructs: events, decorators, service locator
      â””â”€ runtime-core/       # Core runtime interfaces and service locator
```

_(Dependency rule:
source code dependencies must point downward â€”
lower layers must never depend on higher ones.)_

## Testing

Follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Unit** â€“ pure logic (`*-domain`)
- **Integration** â€“ orchestration, infra wiring (`*-app`, `*-infra`)
- **E2E** â€“ user flows (`apps/*`)

```txt
apps/*                    â†’ E2E tests
contexts/<context>-domain â†’ Unit tests
contexts/<context>-app    â†’ Integration tests
contexts/<context>-infra  â†’ Integration tests
shared/*                  â†’ Unit tests (pure logic, utils)
```

## Service Locator

> So on the whole I prefer to avoid it unless I need it.
> This isn't to say it's a bad thing,

While Dependency Injection is a common IoC pattern,
Many TypeScript DI frameworks introduce tight coupling through decorators,
metadata, or framework-specific setup â€”
which can defeat the purpose of IoC.

`cal.com.alt` takes a pragmatic approach using TypeScript interfaces for service location:

- No framework coupling
- Pure TypeScript interfaces and types
- Simple runtime configuration
- Type-safe without string lookups

Example:

```ts
// Service interface to depend on
interface Logger {}

// Service locator
let runtimeServices = {} as { logger: Logger }

// Configure the service locators at application bootstrap
registerServices(runtimeServices, { logger: new ConsoleLogger() })
```

This setup aims for simplicity and decoupling, avoiding DI complexity.
